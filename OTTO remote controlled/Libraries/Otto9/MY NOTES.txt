PLUS:

old compiled size = 91% and 79% free memory = 420 bytes
new compiled size = 89% and 74% free memory = 528 bytes

HUMANOID:

old compiled size = 90% and 89% free memory = 217 bytes
new compiled size = 90% and 84% free memory = 325 bytes

important to allow enough local variable memory for Otto
to complete the 6 servo moves including calls into subroutines
etc, 217 bytes causes crashes, 252 bytes is stable.
So must allow for a minimum of 260 bytes....
